# goonung
Go simple utility helpers to support my work in ideas and projects.

The name **Goonung** is derived from 2 words :
- **Go**, the main core language used for this personal repository
- **Cemenung**, a *350 masl small hill* nearby the village where I was born and grew up, located in south-eastern of *Tulungagung (East Java, Indonesia)*.

## Technology Stack
*Goonung* is developed using :
* **Go 1.13.1 (darwin/amd64)**

And I recommend you to use **Go 1.11** and later to continue to learn or help me to develop these bunch of code, guys.

## Installation
To work with *Goonung*, you can start by using the command :

 - Using `$GOPATH` fundamental
